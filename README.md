LLMs can be faster and more comprehensive than humans at searching and processing information. Our first prototype of AI for DNA synthesis customer screening is just Claude with a long prompt and access a few APIs. The output is a table report for human review, reporting any customer flags and summarizing online findings.

The implementation consists of:

- [SCREENING_GUIDANCE.txt](https://github.com/alejoacelas/cliver-mcp/blob/main/SCREENING_GUIDANCE.txt): The guiding prompt, and our attempt at applying the HHS Screening Guidance to [IBBIS New Customer Form](https://ibbis.bio/our-work/customer-screening/#:~:text=a%20synthesis%20provider.-,New%20Customer%20Form,-The%20information%20on) responses.
- [api.ts](https://github.com/alejoacelas/cliver-mcp/blob/main/api.ts): A simple call to the Anthropic API, with web search and MCPs enabled.
- [mcp/](https://github.com/alejoacelas/cliver-mcp/tree/main/mcp): Connections to the ORCID, EuropePMC, NIH, and the Consolidated Screening List, exposed as functions to Claude through an MCP connection.

While a fair deal of iteration will be needed to codify the practical knowledge of customer screening into a prompt, it wouldn't surprise us if something like this (a prompt + some APIs) were enough to cut the average time it takes to screen DNA synthesis customers by a double-digit percentage. That's already the case for many [financial applications](https://www.greenlite.ai/).

## Try it out

For a ready-made interface, try: [tools.cliver.bio](https://tools.cliver.bio/)

To play around with the prompt and API tools, set this up on your [claude.ai](claude.ai) account:

1. **Connect our MCP:** Go to [Claude's MCP settings](https://claude.ai/settings/connectors?modal=add-custom-connector) and paste this MCP link: https://cf-template.alejoacelas.workers.dev/sse with a name like 'Screening Tools'
2. **Add the guiding prompt:** Paste from SCREENING_GUIDANCE.txt or [click
